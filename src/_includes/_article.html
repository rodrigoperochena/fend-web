        <h3>FeNd's sole aim is the protection of Nature. This organisation is dedicated to giving people a real world solution to save natural habitats, which is as simple as this; BUY THEM. You can purchase acres of rainforest right here on this website's front page, you can share your purchase with friends on social media, and you can find out all about how that works <a href="">here.</a></h3>
        <p>If you purchase rainforest blocks on Fend, your blocks are turned green. When all the blocks are bought the whole page will turn green and you will have been part of the movement that saved 1 million acres of Rainforest.</p>

        <h4>Nature Wins Attitude</h4>
        <p>Saving the environment wont happen by building a fish sculpture out of
          plastic bottles. It wont happen by delivering melancholic awareness
          campaigns with vague intangible outcomes. And it definitely wont
          happen if we believe in the empty vessel of corporate lawmakers eco
          nonsense. Environmentalism, is increasingly becoming a platform for
          peoples politics and emotions, serving the needs of humans; but not
          those of Nature.</p>
        <p>In contrast, Fend is about buying rainforests, because that is what
          works. For the last 30 years significant areas of Rainforests have
          been bought and successfully protected by a couple of amazing
          organisations. The World Land Trust (WLT) pioneered land acquisition
          for conservation, and to date has saved over 700,000 acres. They
          routinely buy rainforest around the world via partnerships with local
          NGO's and empower indigenous people to stay on the lands and protect
          them. It works, it can happen now, and if we can bring much larger
          public attention to this solution, it is easily feasible for millions
          of acres of Rainforest to be saved by the public.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="article__text">
        <h4>Root Problems & Root Solutions</h4>
        <p>An inescapable truth life in 2022, is that human consumption of
          products requires the elimination of wild plants and animals. The
          scale of this generations annihilation of nature, eclipses anything
          committed by previous generations, empires or civilisations (even when
          adjusted for the larger population that exists now than in the past).
          There is no escaping the fact that, to varying degrees, every one of
          us is culpable for what has happened because we are all consumers. And
          while some of us consume many times more than the rest of us, the
          effects of our collective behaviour must surely leave Nature with no
          reason to like us.</p>
        <p>However, many of us really do like Nature and really do want to hang
          on to it. Of that group many are easily in a financial position to
          purchase lands and pay for their protection. In fact 1.6 Billion of us
          have an upper middle to high income. If just 0.12% of this group buy a
          single Fend block each, they can save 1 million acres of Rainforest.</p>

        <h4>Talk the Talk, Walk the Walk</h4>
        <p>Fend is a non profit organisation and registered charity allied with
          the World Land Trust and a land purchasing network of NGOs world wide.
          Fend was setup to popularise and facilitate public participation in
          the purchase of lands upon which the worlds remaining rainforest
          exist. Its primary function could be said to be fundraising. Our
          commitment to the people who care about natural heritage, is to spend
          their money on rainforests, and not waste it on fruitless activities.
          Therefore, we are committed to keeping operations costs at extremely
          low threshold of 5-8%, with 95% spent going into the field. As a
          registered NGO we follow stricter legal and accounting practices than
          public and private companies, and in addition we voluntarily publish
          our
          <a href="">management level accounts</a>. Fend does not have, and
          never will have political or commercial affiliations. We are
          answerable only to our donors. We act solely in the interests of
          Nature.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="article__text">
        <h4>Fend's longer term vision</h4>
        <p><span class="highlight">Consume conservation</span>
          Change public perceptions of conservation, make them understand they
          can win. Some of us are in a financial position to redirect a minor
          fraction of our income away from general consumption and towards
          conservation. We could effectively start "consuming conservation".
          Perhaps on an annual or monthly basis. We could if we wished view this
          as a sort of self imposed cost of living and we could if we wished,
          rise above the reality that most other people wont be part of the
          movement to save nature. Indeed we don't actually need them to be. The
          fraction of our global population that cares about nature can forge
          ahead with land purchases without the rest. For people who are not in
          a financial position to contribute, they can contribute by fundraising
          within their social network. We wish to facilitate this by creating a
          "buy me this" functionality on the website, where users can select
          blocks and send them to friends requesting that they make a purchase
          them for them.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Monetize the Act of Defence</span>
          Acquiring land is the beginning, defending it is the ongoing
          challenge. We live in an era that is focused on monetization. There is
          a solid argument that this trend is exacerbating the pressure on our
          natural heritage. However there is an opportunity to make this trend
          work for nature rather than against it. It is feasible that Fend
          donors blocks are bound to a unit of value other than that of the
          underlying land; the value of conserving it. Remember that untouched
          Rainforest are not idle lumps of land, they are the "lungs of the
          earth". They produce the air we breath, they regulate the climate and
          they store vast amounts of carbon. Seen through a corporate lens, one
          might describe the Rainforests of the planet as a utility. In the not
          so distance future, it is likely that we will see a considerable
          commercial demand for, immediately purchasable units of environmental
          protection. It is therefore feasible, that Fend blocks could yield
          income, not by selling the underlying land, but by selling or renting
          its conservation value. This would further benefit nature if the money
          derived was to be reinvestment in more land.
        </p>
        <p>Given that every block on Fend's front page is already tied to (a) a
          unique identifying number (b) and will be tied to actual piece of
          land, it would be obvious to use public ledger technology (aspects of
          blockchain) to create this unit of value in a tradable token.
          Speculation is one of the most toxic behaviours that civil society's
          and environments have to deal with. Speculators can derive fictitious
          products from elements of the real world for the purpose of gambling.
          The effect is often to skew prices of the derived "product" so far
          above or below where they should, be that thing in the real world from
          which it is derived becomes profoundly negatively effected.
          Conservation presently has no monetary value, if it could be created,
          it could be speculated on and that would create demand for untouched
          Rainforest provided the underlying asset is protected. This would take
          a negative force and to a positive one.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Drive up the cost of nature</span>
          It may sound counterproductive that an organisation who is founded on
          the premise of acquiring land for conservation, would want to make
          that land more expensive. But long term, we need to make forests too
          valuable to set on fire for a few bucks. New buyers in a market lead
          to increased prices. Prices for Rainforest lands are likely to
          increase in value if there are millions of people interested in buying
          them for protective purposes. A major weakness of industrial
          agriculture, and the corporate entities that exploit and destroy
          natural habitats, is that they breathe profits. Actions that reduce
          restrict or eliminate those profits are effective at reducing or
          extinguishing their businesses interests. Slash and burn agriculture
          is generally a tight margin business that requires large economies of
          scale. It is therefore vulnerable to price increase to the underlying
          resource; which is the land.</p>

        <h4>How Purchasing Rinforest Works</h4>
        <p>When you donate to FeNd, we send your money to the World Land Trust, an organisation that over the last 30 years has bought and protected over 700,000 acres of Rainforest. The WLT pioneered land aquisition for conservation, and routinely buys Rainforests around the world through its partnerships with local NGOs. There are three key reasons why this system has proven to work really well over a long period of time:</p>
        <p>1. Part of the money is used to fund the indiginous people to stay on the land and act as rangers, monitoring and protecting it from illegal incursions. The more people that donate to FeNd the greater thespotlight local governments are under to uphold their laws and honour their agreements</p>
        <p>2. Collectively we comand greater purchasing power than if we were seperate. Large donation pool attaracts sellers, large land owners who can cash out and are incentivised to sell.</p>
        <p>3. Local NGO's are in the best position to find and navigate purchases. Their local knowledge both georaphically, culturally and legally, is vital to making successful land purchases. Without the participation of local NGO's it would be hard to connect with local land owners and prohibitively expensive to traverse the legal system. While local NGO's are funded to make the purchase, it is common that the WLT (and in this case FeNd) to take a sufficient share of the ownership to ensure that the land cannot be sold or exploited if the local NGO were to be corrupted.</p>

    <h1 class="article__title">QUESTIONS</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="article__text">
        <h4>DO I OWN THE RAINFOREST?</h4>
        <p>No, legally the local NGO has to hold the titles to the lands. Dividing land for hundreds of thousands of individual donors would be financially and logistically impossible. your money is used to purchase the rainforest through a local NGO and ultimately the legal ownership is shared by the local NGO with the World Land Trust. It is done like this for a few very good reasons. (a) the most cost effective method to get ownership of the land, (b) The local NGO understands the local landscape best (c) The local NGO has an established relationship with the indiginous people who are the vital when it comes to protecting the land.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="article__text">
        <h4>WHO OWNS RAINFORESTS, WHO DO YOU BUY THEM FROM?</h4>
        <p>Land in which Rainforests exist are owned by both private and public entities. It varies from one country to another and is often a mix of both. Large areas of Rainforested lands are owned by individual, companies, local municipalities or national governments. As such they can be bought or leased for exploitation. Very often, natural habitats under the ownership of the local municipality are illegally burnt and occupied while the local municipality turns a blind eye. Land ownership laws vary in strenth from country to country, and this is something that has is navigated by partner NGO's. Fend is happy to be associated with the aquisition of nature as a means to protect it, but in truth, the rainforests are natural heritage, it is a rather vulgar and out dated mindset that says they can be owned.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="article__text">
        <h4>WHERE IS THE RAINFOREST I AM BUYING?</h4>
        <p>One of these locations: Amazon, Peru, Congo, Philipines, Borneo, Papua New Ginue. Your funds are used where they are most needed and where lands are available at the time you donation is bundled into a pool large enough to buy lands.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="article__text">
        <h4>WHEN WILL THE RAINFOREST BE BOUGHT?</h4>
        <p>As soon donors buy in the region of 30,000 blocks their money will have the purchasing power needed to aquire lands. In simple terms, it is akin to buying a house, there is an entry level, and the sky is the limit thereafter. Our focus is directing money where it is most needed and in the shortest time frame. So in essence, as soon as your money can be spent on purchasing rainforest; it will be spent on purchasing rainforest.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="article__text">
        <h4>WHAT HAPPENS IF THE MILION ACRE GOAL IS NOT REACHED?</h4>
        <p>See the above answer. Donor's money is going for the purchase of land regradless of quantities raised. So rest assured when you donate money, rainforest will be aquired on your behalf as soon as circumstances will permit.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="article__text">
        <h4>HOW BIG IS AN ACRE?</h4>
        <p>An acre is equal to: 16 tennis courts, 9.3 basketball courts, 1,032 king size beds. An acre is 43,560 square feet or 4 046.85 square meters.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="article__text">
        <h4>HOW DO I KNOW THIS IS NOT A SCAM?</h4>
        <p>Firstly, check with the charities register : Fend is a registered non-profit, it operates under stricter legal and accounting framework than that of a corporation. Secondly, research our affiliation organizations, they are long standing trustees of the environmental stewardship.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="article__text">
        <h4>CAN RAINFOREST REALLY BE THIS CHEAP?</h4>
        <p>Yes, and there are some interesting reasons: Economics: Burning a jungle down to feed cows or grow palm oil is profitable but not as much as you'd think. The operating expenses are high compared to the profit margins. For example cattle grazing earns as little as $60 an acre. Ecologically: The returns diminish over time because in order to stay in shape, these soils need a forest on them, otherwise they turn to degraded deserts quite quickly (in as little as 5 years). This means that the people who do these things need to pump money into synthetic fertilizers to maintain a viable production yeilds. This temporary solution makes the soil situation even worse and eventually their project colapses and they move on to the next bit. Here is an example: this piece of land sold for X (need new example the Honduras and Philipines exampe is too old, adjust for inflation etc).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="article__text">
        <h4>CAN I SHARE THIS ON SOCIAL MEDIA WITHOUT BUYING A BLOCK?</h4>
        <p>Yes, click this link to dowload a bundle of images you can use.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="article__text">
        <h4>WHY DONT YOU DO A GO FUND ME</h4>
        <p>Because they take a cut of your money and we cannot afford to use your money on that. We are operating on razor thin operations with a view to putting the maximum amount of your money into the land purshases 2. Go fund me's are finite campaigns that have a defined end. FeNd has a much larger vision for conservation, the 1 million acre campaign can be the sart of even bigger and more profound conservation</p>
      </div>
      <div class="article__text">
        <h4>DO YOU RECIEVE CORPORATE FUNDING</h4>
        <p>No, not a cent.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="article__text">
        <h4>HOW MUCH RAINFOREST IS DESTROYED EVERY YEAR?</h4>
        <p>About 3 million acres. 148 million (148263228) acres of rainforest have been illimiated in the last 30 years (since 2002). The tropic are losing about a football pitch of Rainforest every 6 seconds.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="article__text">
        <h4>HOW MUCH THE RAINFORESTS HAVE BEEN DEGRADED OR LOST?</h4>
        <p>About 64%</p>
      </div>
      <div class="article__text">
        <h4>HOW MUCH RAINFOREST DOES THE PLANT HAVE LEFT?</h4>
        <p>About 36% (14.6 million square kilometres) of tropical rainforest remains intact, while 34 per cent of it is completely gone and the remaining 30 per cent has been degraded.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="article__text">
        <h4>CANT WE JUST REPLACE RAINFOREST WITH NEW TREES?</h4>
        <p>No, rainforests are much more than simply trees. They are vastly complex systems with incalcuable interactions between plants, mycelium, animals and the elements. Planting trees is a hugely valuable part of ecological recovery if a diverse range of tree species is used and followed by the re-introduction of flora and fauna. Consider that a pristine Rainforest could contain X of plant species. Much of the earths land wants to become forrest. Land that has been stripped of vegitative cover, animal life, organic matter, soil micobes and fertility, will likely return to forrest if it were left alone, for several hundred years. However, it may not. Many of the worlds grasslands do not sustain tree cover due to their soils profiles inability to support forrest systems. Many of the worlds Rainforests formed at particular epochs in the worlds history when climatic conditions would have favoured their development. Such climatic conditions may not arise again for melenia. In conclusion: temperate and tropical Rainforests are highly complex systems. It cannot be guranteed that man could replace them if he completely destroys them.</p>
