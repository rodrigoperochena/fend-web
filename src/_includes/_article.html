        <h4>FeNd's sole aim is the protection of Nature. This organisation is
        dedicated to giving people a real world solution to save natural
        habitats, which is as simple as this; BUY THEM. You can purchase acres
        of rainforest right here on this website's front page, you can share
        your purchase with friends on social media, and you can find out all
        about how that works <a href="">here.</a></h4>
        <p>If you purchase rainforest blocks on Fend, your blocks are turned
        green. When all the blocks are bought the whole page will turn green
        and you will have been part of the movement that saved 1 million acres
        of Rainforest.</p>

        <h4>Nature Wins Attitude</h4>
        <p>Saving the environment wont happen by building a fish sculpture out of
          plastic bottles. It wont happen by delivering melancholic awareness
          campaigns with vague intangible outcomes. And it definitely wont
          happen if we believe in the empty vessel of corporate lawmakers eco
          nonsense. Environmentalism, is increasingly becoming a platform for
          peoples politics and emotions, serving the needs of humans; but not
          those of Nature.</p>
        <p>In contrast, Fend is about buying rainforests, because that is what
          works. For the last 30 years significant areas of Rainforests have
          been bought and successfully protected by a couple of amazing
          organisations. The World Land Trust (WLT) pioneered land acquisition
          for conservation, and to date has saved over 700,000 acres. They
          routinely buy rainforest around the world via partnerships with local
          NGO's and empower indigenous people to stay on the lands and protect
          them. It works, it can happen now, and if we can bring much larger
          public attention to this solution, it is easily feasible for millions
          of acres of Rainforest to be saved by the public.</p>

        <h4>Root Problems & Root Solutions</h4>
        <p>An inescapable truth life in 2022, is that human consumption of
          products requires the elimination of wild plants and animals. The
          scale of this generations annihilation of nature, eclipses anything
          committed by previous generations, empires or civilisations (even when
          adjusted for the larger population that exists now than in the past).
          There is no escaping the fact that, to varying degrees, every one of
          us is culpable for what has happened because we are all consumers. And
          while some of us consume many times more than the rest of us, the
          effects of our collective behaviour must surely leave Nature with no
          reason to like us.</p>
        <p>However, many of us really do like Nature and really do want to hang
          on to it. Of that group many are easily in a financial position to
          purchase lands and pay for their protection. In fact 1.6 Billion of us
          have an upper middle to high income. If just 0.12% of this group buy a
          single Fend block each, they can save 1 million acres of Rainforest.</p>

        <h4>Talk the Talk, Walk the Walk</h4>
        <p>Fend is a non profit organisation and registered charity allied with
          the World Land Trust and a land purchasing network of NGOs world wide.
          Fend was setup to popularise and facilitate public participation in
          the purchase of lands upon which the worlds remaining rainforest
          exist. Its primary function could be said to be fundraising. Our
          commitment to the people who care about natural heritage, is to spend
          their money on rainforests, and not waste it on fruitless activities.
          Therefore, we are committed to keeping operations costs at extremely
          low threshold of 5-8%, with 95% spent going into the field. As a
          registered NGO we follow stricter legal and accounting practices than
          public and private companies, and in addition we voluntarily publish
          our
          <a href="">management level accounts</a>. Fend does not have, and
          never will have political or commercial affiliations. We are
          answerable only to our donors. We act solely in the interests of
          Nature.</p>

        <h4>Fend's longer term vision</h4>
        <p><span class="highlight">Consume conservation</span>
          Change public perceptions of conservation, make them understand they
          can win. Some of us are in a financial position to redirect a minor
          fraction of our income away from general consumption and towards
          conservation. We could effectively start "consuming conservation".
          Perhaps on an annual or monthly basis. We could if we wished view this
          as a sort of self imposed cost of living and we could if we wished,
          rise above the reality that most other people wont be part of the
          movement to save nature. Indeed we don't actually need them to be. The
          fraction of our global population that cares about nature can forge
          ahead with land purchases without the rest. For people who are not in
          a financial position to contribute, they can contribute by fundraising
          within their social network. We wish to facilitate this by creating a
          "buy me this" functionality on the website, where users can select
          blocks and send them to friends requesting that they make a purchase
          them for them.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Monetize the Act of Defence</span>
          Acquiring land is the beginning, defending it is the ongoing
          challenge. We live in an era that is focused on monetization. There is
          a solid argument that this trend is exacerbating the pressure on our
          natural heritage. However there is an opportunity to make this trend
          work for nature rather than against it. It is feasible that Fend
          donors blocks are bound to a unit of value other than that of the
          underlying land; the value of conserving it. Remember that untouched
          Rainforest are not idle lumps of land, they are the "lungs of the
          earth". They produce the air we breath, they regulate the climate and
          they store vast amounts of carbon. Seen through a corporate lens, one
          might describe the Rainforests of the planet as a utility. In the not
          so distance future, it is likely that we will see a considerable
          commercial demand for, immediately purchasable units of environmental
          protection. It is therefore feasible, that Fend blocks could yield
          income, not by selling the underlying land, but by selling or renting
          its conservation value. This would further benefit nature if the money
          derived was to be reinvestment in more land.
        </p>
        <p>Given that every block on Fend's front page is already tied to (a) a
          unique identifying number (b) and will be tied to actual piece of
          land, it would be obvious to use public ledger technology (aspects of
          blockchain) to create this unit of value in a tradable token.
          Speculation is one of the most toxic behaviours that civil society's
          and environments have to deal with. Speculators can derive fictitious
          products from elements of the real world for the purpose of gambling.
          The effect is often to skew prices of the derived "product" so far
          above or below where they should, be that thing in the real world from
          which it is derived becomes profoundly negatively effected.
          Conservation presently has no monetary value, if it could be created,
          it could be speculated on and that would create demand for untouched
          Rainforest provided the underlying asset is protected. This would take
          a negative force and to a positive one.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Drive up the cost of nature</span>
          It may sound counterproductive that an organisation who is founded on
          the premise of acquiring land for conservation, would want to make
          that land more expensive. But long term, we need to make forests too
          valuable to set on fire for a few bucks. New buyers in a market lead
          to increased prices. Prices for Rainforest lands are likely to
          increase in value if there are millions of people interested in buying
          them for protective purposes. A major weakness of industrial
          agriculture, and the corporate entities that exploit and destroy
          natural habitats, is that they breathe profits. Actions that reduce
          restrict or eliminate those profits are effective at reducing or
          extinguishing their businesses interests. Slash and burn agriculture
          is generally a tight margin business that requires large economies of
          scale. It is therefore vulnerable to price increase to the underlying
          resource; which is the land.</p>
